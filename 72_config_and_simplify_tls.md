## Summary

The configuration options present in the old `keylime.conf` are cleaned up and
split into individual files corresponding to each of the sections.

The TLS configuration options are simplified to make the naming more consistent
and intuitive.

The new configuration format is versioned to allow for simpler upgrades in the
future.

## Motivation

The Keylime configuration for different components are all in one single file
and there is no versioning to control newly introduced configuration options and
possibly implementing upgrading mechanisms for the configuration files.

The current way TLS is setup in Keylime is confusing, with inconsistent naming
scheme, and complex CA certificates configuration options.

Keylime uses the Python specific INI inspired configuration format and
mixes different data types (comma separated list vs. Python syntax).

### Goals
* Split the `keylime.conf` configuration file into files: `agent.conf`,
  `tenant.conf`, `registrar.conf`, `verifier.conf`, `ca.conf`, and
  `logging.conf`
* Add versioning to the configuration files
* Provide a migration tool to port current single Keylime configurations to the
  new split format
* Simplify the TLS setup of Keylime
* Cleanup keylime_ca to make it work with the new setup
* Formally allow the Rust agent configuration to diverge from the Python agent
  configuration

### Non-Goals

* Implement other mechanisms of authentication other than mTLS
* Move registration to HTTPS
* Add a migration path for all possible old Keylime configurations

## Proposal - TLS setup simplification

The current Keylime TLS setup allows setting the CA certificate to trust, the
private key, and certificate to be used when accessing each different component
as a client.

In the new configuration, components that access multiple servers use a single
key pair and certificate to access all servers. This reduces the flexibility,
but also reduces the complexity of the TLS configuration.

Each component has options to set a private key and certificate to be used for
each performed role (client and server). Note that not all components perform
both roles (client and server).

The new configuration introduces new options to set the trusted CA
certificates. Each component that connects to servers gets the
`trusted_server_ca` option to set the list of trusted server CA certificates,
and each component that acts as a server gets the `trusted_client_ca` to set the
list of trusted client CA certificates.

The old TLS configuration options are replaced with the following:

* `tls_dir`: Path to the directory where key and certificate files are located
* `enable_agent_mtls`: Enable the agent TLS with mutual authentication
* `client_key`: Private key used for TLS client side authentication
* `client_cert`: Certificate used for TLS client side authentication
* `server_key`: Private key used for TLS server side authentication
* `server_cert`: Certificate used for TLS server side authentication
* `trusted_client_ca`: List of trusted CAs for client certificates
* `trusted_server_ca`: List of trusted CAs for server certificates

Other TLS related options are removed.

The new TLS configuration options accept special keywords listed below:

* `default`: When this keyword is provided, the default value for the option is
  used. The table below lists the options that accept the `default` keyword and
  the value used when the keyword is provided:

| Option | Default value |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `tls_dir` | `/var/lib/keylime/cv_ca` for server components. `/var/lib/keylime/secure` for the agent. |
| `client_key` | `client.key` |
| `client_cert` | `client_cert.pem` |
| `server_key` | `server.key` |
| `server_cert` | `server_cert.pem` |
| `trusted_client_ca` | `[cacert.pem]` |
| `trusted_server_ca` | `[cacert.pem]` |

* `all` (only valid for `trusted_client_ca` and `trusted_server_ca`): Disables validation of
  the certificates.
* `generate` (only valid for `tls_dir`): Generates a CA with the correct certificates.
  The agent generates the key and certificate when they are not present
  regardless of this option.

The following sub-sections describe the changes to TLS related options for each
component.

### Agent

For the agent the changes are only the options naming scheme changes to make it
consistent with the other components. Since the agent does not access other
components as a client using TLS, it does not have the `client_key`,
`client_cert`, and `trusted_server_ca` options.

The following table summarizes the changes from the old configuration file
format.

| Old option          | New Option          | Notes |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| `rsa_keyname`       | `server_key`        | |
| `mtls_cert_enabled` | `enable_agent_mtls` | |
| `mtls_cert`         | `server_cert`       | |
| `keylime_ca`        | `trusted_client_ca` | Add the verifier and tenant clients CA certificates to `trusted_client_ca`|

### Verifier

For the verifier, besides the options naming scheme changes for consistency,
some options are removed since only one client key pair and certificate can be
set to access the other components.

Also the option to use password protected private keys is no longer supported,
allowing the `private_key_pw` and `agent_mtls_private_key_pw` to be removed.

The following table summarizes the changes for the verifier TLS configuration.

| Old option                 | New Option          | Notes |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| `tls_dir`                  | `tls_dir`           | |
| `ca_cert`                  | `trusted_client_ca` | Add the tenant client CA certificate to `trusted_client_ca`|
| `my_cert`                  | `server_cert`       | |
| `private_key`              | `server_key`        | |
| `private_key_pw`           | (None, removed)     | Removed support for password protected private keys |
| `check_client_cert`        | (None, removed)     | Use `all` keyword in `trusted_client_ca`|
| `agent_mtls_cert_enabled`  | `enable_agent_mtls` | |
| `agent_mtls_cert`          | `client_cert`       | Add the CA of the agent's `server_cert` to `trusted_server_ca`
| `agent_mtls_private_key`   | `client_key`        | |
| `agent_mtls_private_key_pw`| (None, removed)     | Removed support for password protected private keys |

### Tenant

The tenant access multiple components as a client. The old configuration format
allows to set different private keys and certificates to be used when accessing
each different component. In the new configuration format, all services are
accessed using the same private key (`client_key`) and certificate
(`client_cert`).

To allow the components to authenticate the tenant, it is necessary to add the
tenant CA certificate to the `trusted_client_ca` list in each component
configuration.

Also the option to use password protected private keys is no longer supported,
allowing the `private_key_pw`, `agent_mtls_private_key_pw`, and
`registrar_private_key_pw` to be removed.

| Old option                 | New Option          | Notes |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| `tls_dir`                  | `tls_dir`           | |
| `ca_cert`                  | `trusted_server_ca` | Add the verifier CA certificate to `trusted_server_ca`|
| `my_cert`                  | `client_cert`       | |
| `private_key`              | `client_key`        | |
| `private_key_pw`           | (None, removed)     | Removed support for password protected private keys |
| `check_client_cert`        | (None, removed)     | Use `all` keyword in `trusted_client_ca`|
| `agent_mtls_cert_enabled`  | `enable_agent_mtls` | |
| `agent_mtls_cert`          | (None, removed)     | Add the CA of the agent's `server_cert` to `trusted_server_ca`
| `agent_mtls_private_key`   | `client_key`        | |
| `agent_mtls_private_key_pw`| (None, removed)     | Removed support for password protected private keys |
| `registrar_tls_dir`        | (None, removed)     | Use `tls_dir` |
| `registrar_ca_cert`        | (None, removed)     | Add the CA of the registrar's `server_cert` to `trusted_server_ca`|
| `registrar_my_cert`        | `client_cert`       | |
| `registrar_private_key`    | `client_key`        | |
| `registrar_private_key_pw` | (None, removed)     | Removed support for password protected private keys |
| `check_client_cert`        | (None, removed)     | Use `all` keyword in `trusted_client_ca`|

### Registrar

For the registrar, the options are renamed to follow the new naming scheme and
some options are removed since there is no need to set multiple server private
keys and certificates.

The registrar does not access other services as a client, thus it does not have
the `client_key`, `client_cert`, and `trusted_server_ca` options.

Also the option to use password protected private keys is no longer supported,
allowing the `private_key_pw` and `registrar_private_key_pw` to be removed.

The following table summarizes the changes for the registrar TLS configuration.

| Old option                 | New Option          | Notes |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| `registrar_tls_port`       | `tls_port`          | |
| `tls_dir`                  | `tls_dir`           | |
| `ca_cert`                  | `trusted_client_ca` | Add the tenant CA certificates to `trusted_client_ca`|
| `my_cert`                  | `server_cert`       | |
| `private_key`              | `server_key`        | |
| `private_key_pw`           | (None, removed)     | Removed support for password protected private keys |
| `registrar_tls_dir`        | (None, removed)     | Use `tls_dir` |
| `registrar_private_key_pw` | (None, removed)     | Removed support for password protected private keys |
| `check_client_cert`        | (None, removed)     | Use `all` keyword in `trusted_client_ca`|

## Proposal - Split the configuration into individual files for each component and cleanup options

The proposal consists in moving the configuration options from the current
configuration file sections into individual configuration files corresponding to
each of the sections.

As part of the options cleanup, the TLS configuration is simplified with the
goal to make the options naming more consistent and intuitive between the
different components, as described in the sections above.

The global configuration section is removed as the options present in that
section are not necessary in the new configuration format.

The logging and CA related sections are moved to dedicated configuration files.

The following table shows the file which contains the options from each of
the old configuration sections:

| Old configuration section   | File in new configuration |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `[general]`                 | (None, removed)           |
| `[cloud_agent]`             | `agent.conf`              |
| `[cloud_verifier]`          | `verifier.conf`           |
| `[registrar]`               | `registrar.conf`          |
| `[tenant]`                  | `tenant.conf`             |
| `[ca]`                      | `ca.conf`                 |
| `[loggers]`                 | `logging.conf`            |
| `[handlers]`                | `logging.conf`            |
| `[formatters]`              | `logging.conf`            |
| `[logger_root]`             | `logging.conf`            |
| `[handler_consoleHandler]`  | `logging.conf`            |
| `[logger_keylime]`          | `logging.conf`            |

When packaging Keylime, distributions should ship the default configuration
files in `/usr/etc/keylime/` or, if not supported, in `/etc/keylime/`. When
`/etc/keylime/` is populated, the options from files in  `/usr/etc/keylime`
should be ignored. Manual overrides can be provided in files in
`/etc/keylime.d/`.

The Rust agent implementation can diverge from the configuration file format
used by the Python agent implementation, including adopting different
configuration options.

### Unification of data types
Since the configuration is for software written in Python the default Python
types are used.

* Booleans: `True` and `False`
* String: Strings; can be double quoted or not (e.g. `test = test.txt` or `test = "test with space.txt"`)
* List: Defined as in Python (e.g. `[1, 2, "string"]`)
* Dictionary: Defined as in Python (e.g. `{"key": "value", "key2": 1}`)

Internal APIs to convert the entries in this format to Python structures should
be provided. A suggestion is to provide a `getlist()` and `getdict()` APIs that
use `ast.literal_eval` to convert values from the format defined above to Python
structures.

The following sub-sections describe the content of each of the new configuration
files.

### Simplification of database configuration

The following options are removed in favor of keeping only the `database_url`
option for database configuration:

* `database_drivername`
* `database_username`
* `database_password`
* `database_host`
* `database_name`

### Removal of unused default values from the configuration file

The following options define default values which are mostly unused and
therefore are removed:

* `tmp_policy`
* `ima_allowlist`
* `ima_excludelist`

### agent.conf

This file contains the configuration options used by the Keylime agent.  The
option are derived from the options present in the `[cloud_agent]` section from
the old configuration file.

The following table lists the old options and the corresponding new options.

### `logging.conf`

The logging configuration uses multiple sections in the old configuration
format.  In the new configuration format such sections are moved to a dedicated
`logging.conf` file, but no changes are made to the options and section names.

The sections moved to the `logging.conf` file are:

* `[loggers]`
* `[handlers]`
* `[formatters]`
* `[logger_root]`
* `[handler_consoleHandler]`
* `[logger_keylime]`

### User Stories (optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this enhancement is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system.  The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

#### Story 2

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (optional)

The new TLS configuration removes the possibility to set separate private key
and certificate per remote server, limiting to use a single private key and
certificate to access all servers.

### Risks and Mitigations

Setting up the client TLS verification is important for the overall security of
Keylime. Warning for obvious insecure settings should be added where not already
in place. The documentation will describe the default configuration and one more
complex setup as a reference.

## Design Details

The tool to convert the old configuration file to the new configuration format,
split in multiple files, should be implemented as a python script.

### Test Plan

The current tests will be modified to use the new configuration file format and
options names.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

For the most common setups we provide a migration script to the new config
format. If only an old `keylime.conf` is found Keylime will error with a message
that migration to the new format is required.

Automatic downgrading will not be supported. The user can just use their old `keylime.conf`.


### Dependency requirements


## Drawbacks

* Configuration must be migrated. We will not support the old and the new format
  simultaneously.
* The support to set components to use different client private key and
  certificate per accessed server is removed. Each component that access servers
  as clients will use a single private key and certificate to access all servers.

## Alternatives

* Keep the current TLS setup and configuration file format
