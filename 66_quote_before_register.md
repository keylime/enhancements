## Release Signoff Checklist

<!--
**ACTION REQUIRED:** In order to merge code into a release, there must be an
issue in [keylime/enhancements] referencing this enhancement and targeting a release**.

For enhancements that make changes to code or processes/procedures in core
Keylime i.e., [keylime/keylime], we require the following Release
Signoff checklist to be completed.

Check these off as they are completed for the Release Team to track. These
checklist items _must_ be updated for the enhancement to be released.
-->

- [ ] Enhancement issue in release milestone, which links to pull request in [keylime/enhancements]
- [ ] Core members have approved the issue with the label `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented
- [ ] Test plan is in place
- [ ] User-facing documentation has been created in [keylime/keylime-docs]

<!--
**Note:** This checklist is iterative and should be reviewed and updated every time this enhancement is being considered for a milestone.
-->

## Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high quality user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap.  It should be
possible to collect this information before implementation begins in order to
avoid requiring implementers to split their attention between writing release
notes and implementing the feature itself. Reviewers
should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is
useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.
-->

This document proposes that agents are added to the verifier only after the
initial identity quote they provide to the tenant are successfully verified.

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals and non-goals of
this enhancement.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users.
-->

Currently, the tenant first adds the agent to the verifier and then handles the
provided initial quote, resulting in untrusted agents added to the verifier
database.

This behavior resulted in the following reported issue:
* https://github.com/keylime/keylime/issues/680

A related issue which could be mitigated by this enhancement:
* https://github.com/keylime/keylime/issues/679

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the enhancement.  What is it trying to achieve?  How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

* Only trusted agents are added to the verifier database.

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this enhancement?  Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

* Make the operational states to be indicators of the agent trusted state.

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation.  The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

The tenant must request initial identity quote to the agent and verify the quote
before adding the agent to the verifier database.

### User Stories (optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this enhancement is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system.  The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

* The user requests the tenant to add an agent
* The tenant requests the initial identity quote to the agent
* The tenant verifies the provided initial quote
* If the initial quote is successfully verified, the tenant proceeds and adds
    the agent to the verifier

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above.
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate.  Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
enhancement ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed and by whom?
-->

The enhancement proposed in this document changes the current behavior as an
agent will not be added to the verifier unless the initial quote they provide is
verified. If the current behavior is preferred, this enhancement proposal should
be rejected.

If the Keylime tenant is upgraded in an existing deployment in which the
verifier database already contains untrusted agents, but before these agents
provide initial identity quote, it is possible that the initial identity quote
is never requested to these untrusted agents.

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable.  This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets.  If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

The main modification would be changing the order of the operations executed by
the tenant by swapping the `do_cv()` and `do_quote()` calls and fixing eventual
dependencies `do_quote()` has from `do_cv()` (e.g. removing the agent from the
verifier in case of failure).

It may be required to change the order of the operational states `REGISTERED`
and `GET_QUOTE` or changing the semantics of the states `START` and
`REGISTERED`.

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy.  Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly
challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations).
-->

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this enhancement
-->

If the upgrade happens after an untrusted agent is added to the database and
before they provide the initial identity quote, it is possible that the initial
identity quote is never requested to these untrusted agents.

For this reason the upgrade should not be done before checking the state of all
agents added to the verifier.

There is no risk for new deployments where the verifier database does not
contain any agent.

### Dependencie requirements

<!--
If your new change requires new dependencies, please outline and demonstrate that your selected dependency
is well maintained and packaged in Keylime's supported Operating Systems (currently Debian Stable
and as of time writing Fedora 32/33).

During code implementation you will also be expected to add the package to CI , the keylime ansible role and
keylimes main installer (`keylime/installers.sh`).

If the package is not available in the supported Operated systems, the PR will not be merged into master.

Adding the package in `requirements.txt` is not sufficent for master which is where we tag releases from.

You may however be able to work within an experimental branch until a package is made available. If this is
the case, please outline it in this enhancement.

-->

* There are no new required dependencies.

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this enhancement _not_ be implemented?
-->

* There are no known drawbacks.

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider and why did you rule them out?  These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

* Keep the current behavior, accepting untrusted agents to be added to the
    verifier database.

## Infrastructure Needed (optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things infrastructure related specific to your enhancement.  Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, github webhook, changes to CI (travis).
-->

No infrastructure change needed.
