## Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high quality user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap.  It should be
possible to collect this information before implementation begins in order to
avoid requiring implementers to split their attention between writing release
notes and implementing the feature itself. Reviewers
should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is
useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.
-->

Keylime is at present monolithic in that there is no concept of multi tenancy in
the form of groups, users and permission based access control of Keylime agents.

This enhancement sets the foundation for developing Keylime into a multi tenant
capable system.

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals and non-goals of
this enhancement.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users.
-->

Keylime works in the context of a single tenant. Any agents registered within
Keylime can be managed by anyone with the required bootstrap certificates (mTLS).

An owner of a Keylime deployment may want to provide services to multiple tenants
and allow them to manage and create their own users, groups and
administrators, while isolating the control commands available for agents to
members of a certain group(s).

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the enhancement.  What is it trying to achieve?  How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

* Implement a multi tenancy model within Keylime to allow the creation and
management of users, groups and group administrators.

* Implement a root admin who has an overall level or privilege to create and manage
groups and group administrators.

* Implement a means to fix an agent to a group and user.

* Provide a scalable authentication system to arbiter access of Keylime's APIs.

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this enhancement?  Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

Separate data view controls (such as logs) in the verifier. This would require
a significant refactor of how the verifier operates and therefore
requires its own enhancement.

Roles will be limited to standard users and admins (root or group based). A means
to create roles with a more granular level of access (can do X, but not Y) will
require a new enhancement proposal.

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation.  The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

This proposal will develop and deliver the following features:

* Database amendments to introduce groups, users and roles with the verifier.

* A federated method for user(s) or administrator(s) to pass credentials (in the
  form of tokens) to the verifier API and prove their identity to Keylime.

* A method to associate agents to a group or user and a means for
administrators to re-associate agents with a different group ("change group").

### Risks and Mitigation's

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate.  Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
enhancement ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed and by whom?
-->

Multi tenancy introduces its own set of security risks in the form of information
leakage and unauthorised access.

To address this the enhancement will utlise JWT tokens and password hashing
for passwords that are stored within the database.

This change will seek to use existing security modules such as PyJWT and will
build upon the existing access controls already present in Keylime (mTLS). Therefore
access control will be more robust as a "belt and braces" access control
configuration of both scoped token based sessions and mTLS certificates can be
leveraged.

Username passwords will be salted within the database  to mitigate rainbow table
attacks (in the case of a compromised database) and the sending of passwords
within HTTP headers will be encrypted via mTLS / TLS.

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable.  This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets.  If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

Central to the design, will be the introduction of "users". Users are accounts
which will be used for machines / humans to interact with the RestFUL API's
available within the verifier and provide role based access control.

Alongside users, will be the introductions of "groups". "users" will belong to
"groups" and will only be able to operate within the context of the group(s) to
which they belong. Agents (`agent_id`) will mapped to groups. This will
then restrict the sending of command to only agents within the group in which the
agent is currently associated with.

A root admin will be created within the verifier database at deploy time and
will be unremovable. Creation of new groups will only be possible using the root
admin account. When a new group is created, an admin role for that group will be
automatically.

Any user of Keylime, will first need to call an Auth Handler to authenticate
their user account. Should this authentication pass, the user will be provided
with a JWT token. This token will then be added to as a Bearer Token to subsequent
HTTP calls to protected handlers.

### JWTauth

[JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) will be introduced as a means for users to
authorise themselves and access the verifiers APIs.

JWT is proposed as it provides us with a means to federate authentication
over multiple verifiers.

To enable JWT, the [PyJWT](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) module
will be imported into Keylimes code and become Keylime dependency.

Users will then be required to authorise themselves and upon successful
authorization, be provided with a time limited scoped JWT token.

To deliver this feature it will require a `@JWTauth` python decorator which can
easily be set over each handler that requires authorised access controls.

```
@jwtauth
class SomeHandler(BaseHandler):
```

JWT will be configurable in `keylime.conf` where users of Keylime can set a
preferred HMAC, for example:

`jwt_dsa = HS512`

#### Examples of use

An admin authenticates themselves to the `\auth` authentication URI.

```
curl --location --request GET 'https://verifier:8881/auth?username=admin&password=password'
```

The admin then makes a call to create a user using a Bearer token received as
part of the previous call to the `/auth` handler.

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://verifier:8881/user/register?username=peter&password=password&email=peter@gmail.com&group_id=1234' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJncm91cF9pZCI6MSwicm9sZV9pZCI6MSwiZXhwIjoxNTkyOTMwNjM0fQ.qiAl6n9a_PlGsiLZMxiWtzs_uoq2tAtCr29Gu8euaph0rLXLMZwj41sq5p3yM-u7xiMtRXmrS9MoCpgIyh2owA'
```

### Database changes

There will also be new tables introduced to the verifiers database

 * `users`: a table store user information
 * `groups`: a table to store group information
 * `roles`: a table to store role information

Declarative mappings will be made from `agent_id` in the `verifiermain` table
to a new `groups` table. This will allow isolation of agent command rights to
only users within the same group.

Declarative mappings will also be made from `users` to `groups` and `roles`

#### users table

| row name | row properties                                |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| user_id  | Integer (primary_key)                         |
| username | String                                        |
| password | String                                        |
| email    | String                                        |
| group_id | Integer (declarative mapping to groups table) |
| role_id  | Integer (declarative mapping to roles table)  |

#### groups table

| row name   | row properties                                                          |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| group_id   | Integer (primary_key) (declarative mapping to users table)              |
| group_name | String                                                                  |
| role_id    | String (declarative mapping to the roles table)                         |

#### roles table

| row name  | row properties                                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| role_id   | Integer (primary_key) (declarative mapping to groups & users table) |
| role_name | String                                                              |
| group_id  | String (declarative mapping to the groups and users table)          |

Amendments will be made to the `verifiermain` table create to declarative mapping
to the groups table of the `verifiermain:agent_id` row.

The `werkzeug` library will be used for secure password salting of database
stored user passwords.

### New handlers

JWT handlers will be introduced to provide authorization protect access of the
`AgentsHandler` tornado handler.

The `AgentsHandler` will be extended to allow a 'change group' call.

Two new handlers will be introduced:

#### UsersHandler

`UsersHandler` - will provide the following HTTP methods:

* `GET`: Get a list of users or details of a specific user from the system (requires
  the caller to be the admin of the group in which the user resides or the root admin.
  A call for a specific user can only be made by admins or the user themselves.

* `POST`: Limited to only root admin or group admin. Allows creation of a specific
    user. The following params should be populated:
    * `username`: Username of the new user
    * `password`: Password of the new user
    * `email`: New users email address
    * `group_id`: The group_id of the users primary group

A `role_id` will be auto generated (incremented from last value).

* `PATCH`: Patch will be used to change user passwords or amend the group(s) of an
  existing user.

* `DELETE`: Limited to only root admin or group admin. Allows deletion of a user.

#### GroupsHandler

`GroupsHandler` - will provide the following HTTP methods:

All calls to the `GroupsHandler` require a root admin account, with the exception
of the `GET` method.

* `GET`: Get a list of groups or details of a specific group from the system.

* `POST`: Allows creation of a new group. The following params should be populated;
    * `group_name`: The name of the group.
    * `group_desc`: A description of the group.


* `PATCH`: Patch will be used to change groups name or description.

* `DELETE`: Allows deletion of a group. This operation will cascade remove all
  users and agents the admin that exist within the group. the recommendation is
  that admins should move all agents and users out of the group (should they wish
  to retain them).

#### AuthHandler

`AuthHandler` - will extract the username and password from a `GET` request to
 an `\auth` uri. The `werkzeug.security` module will then be used to perform
 a database lookup using `check_password_hash`.

### Agent registration changes

Changes will be made so that when an authenticated user adds an agent, the
agent will be associated with the user and the group in which the user belongs.

Further commands (add, delete, update) made to the verifier against a particular
agent(s) will require the caller to be the same user (within the same group)
that originally added the agent or the administrator of the group or the root
administrator.

### TLS Changes

Operators will be provided with the following choices:

1. mTLS and JWT auth.
2. TLS and JWT Auth.

TLS will be added to make it easier to set up tenant nodes and multi
verifiers. Currently it is required to create certification on the verifier
and then transfer client certs to the tenant machine and register.

### Pull request approach

Implementation of multi tenancy requires a substantially rework of the code base
and introduction of new functionality. To provide ease of review and implementation
this enhancement will be delivered in different stages as individual pull
requests.

This will be done in a manner that limits the need to break backwards compatibility
or require complex upgrade tasks.

The first change will introduce the JWT framework and the means to create and
manage users.

The second change will implement a system to manage agents within a Multi Tenancy
manner, such as register an agent to a particular group and / or user and allow
administrators to move agents to another group.

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy.  Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly
challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations).
-->

Unit tests will be provided to test the database classes and JWT. Tests will also
be amended to require that a JWT token be scoped.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.
