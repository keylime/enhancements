## Summary

This enhancement proposes a way to allow Keylime to automatically
import IMA Allow-Lists from external sources. These allow-lists will
follow a prescribed JSON format that allows the `keylime_tenant` to
download, cryptographically verify and then upload these lists to the
verifier. This will be done in versioned manner to allow upgrades and
extensions in the future.

## Motivation

Keylime currently places the burden of creating and managing allowlists
upon the user.  Currently the way to generate these allow-lists is to
air-gap the machine after it’s been installed and configured and then
run a script which crawls the filesystem and records SHA256 hashes into
a file. This file is then loaded into keylime with the `keylime_tenant`
command at which point the machine can be put back into circulation and
keylime will continually verify it’s state.

This extra process is a burden when provisioning new resources for a
cluster. It also means adding keylime to an existing cluster requires
reducing the capacity of that cluster as batches of machines are pulled
out for allow-list generation. Another downside is that the allow-lists
generated are unique per-machine and managing large per-machine
allow-lists is another administrative task on cluster operations.

We want to make this process simpler and more automated for more use
cases. This will not only help Keylime users scale up their usage, but
also increase adoption and make Keylime more attractive for downstream
projects.


### Goals

* Create a simple, versioned JSON format spec for allow-lists
* Make it easy and secure for keylime users to point `keylime_tenant` at remote allow-lists
* Allow users to cryptographically verify the signature or checksum (or both) of the allow-lists
* Document everything and provide at least one real world integration example (Fedora CoreOS)

### Non-Goals

This will be the starting point for many future integrations with keylime, but for now we will not:

* Integrate with other secure supply chain initiatives like in-toto, Tekton/chains or Co-Swids
* Include non-files in the allow-lists (like SELinux Labels, boot arguments, etc)

## Proposal

These are the proposed changes:

* Document the first version of the allow-list JSON spec
* Update the `allowlist` option to handle the new documented JSON spec
* Add the following arguments to `keylime_tenant`

  * `allowlist-url`
    An HTTP URL that points to the remote JSON data file. This URL must
    be secure (HTTPS), and non-redirecting (no 30X HTTP codes) to reduce
    the chance of any MITM attacks. If this option is specified then
    you can't also have the `--allowlist` option present.

    If this option is present, then you must use one of `allowlist-sig`,
    `allowlist-sig-url` or `allowlist-checksum` to verify the contents
    of the downloaded file.

  * `allowlist-sig`
    The cryptographic signature of the remote JSON data file.
    Cannot be specified if `allowlist` isn't also present.

  * `allowlist-sig-url`
    An HTTP URL that points to the GPG signature of the JSON
    data file. Again, This URL must be secure (HTTPS), and non-redirecting
    (no 30X HTTP codes) to reduce the chance of any MITM attacks. This
    option cannot be specified if `allowlist` or `allowlist-url` isn't also
    present.

  * `allowlist-sig-key`
    The key used to verify the `allowlist-sig` or `allowlist-sig-url`
    and is required if one of those options is also present.

  * `allowlist-checksum`
    The SHA256 checksum of the allow-list. This can be used to verify
    that the allow-list hasn't been tampered. You must either verify
    the checksum or signature (or both) of the allow-list.

* Expand the way allow-lists are passed between the tenant and the
verifier to use JSON instead of the simple text file that exists now. This
makes the contract more explicit and allows for expansion in the future.

* Add routines to validate the JSON that will be utilized by both
the tenant and the verifier. The tenant first to provide a better and
faster experience for the end user and the verifier to make sure it
can't be bypassed.

### User Stories

#### Story 1

As a Fedora CoreOS user, I already know every package that could be
present on my system based on my ostree version. I want to just tell
Keylime where to find the list of file hashes for my specific version
and let it do the rest

#### Story 2

I have a secure build process that can produce allow-lists for the
software my team is building. I can store these allow-lists in an external
repository (say an OCI registry). As part of my build/release process I
have the cryptographic signatures of these allow-lists. I would like to
tell keylime about these lists when deploying and provide the signature
to keylime to verify it pulled the expected lists.

### Risks and Mitigations

* We will be updating the internal API between the tenant and the
verifier to use the new JSON spec. Care will be taken to make sure
this is done in a backwards compatible way so existing instances of
keylime can continue to use their existing allowlists. If backwards
compatibility can't be maintained good documentation and a utility in
`scripts/` will be created to help users migrate to the new format.

* We will need to thoroughly review our handling of the external HTTP
connections to make sure they are as secure as possible and don't do
things like accept invalid TLS certificates.

* We will need to thoroughly review our handling of the cryptographic
signatures and checksums

## Design Details

Propsed JSON spec:

```javascript
{
    "meta": {
        "version":  "",    // Hash format version to allow for future changes if needed (required)
        "generator": "",   // What generated the hash payload
        "timestamp": ""    // When the hash payload was generated
    },
    "release": "",         // Release Identifier. Specifics here may be different for different compound components
    "hashes": {            // List of hashes to validate (required)
        "/filesystem/path":  [ "HASH1", "HASH2" ],
        "/filesystem/path2": [ "HASH3", "HASH4" ],
    }
}
```

### Test Plan

TBD

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy.  Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly
challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations).

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

TBD

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this enhancement

## Drawbacks

If we are concerned about not using existing data formats (like in-toto) we should not implement this design.

## Alternatives

Instead of baking the URL retrieval and Hash verification into
`keylime_tenant` itself, we could create an additional utility that
would perform those actions and then translate the JSON allow-lists
into the current format. Then `keylime_tenant` could be called on the
new resulting allowlist.

I believe this is a less desireable approach because it means we have yet
another script that users would have to run in order to get the desired
integration. While one more step isn't drastic, it does allow more room
for error and creates more friction.


## Infrastructure Needed (optional)

For the keylime side there is no additional infrastructure needed. For
the end-to-end documented example using Fedore CoreOS we will need
to coordinate with that team to make sure the URLs are in place for
allow-list retrieval and verification.
