## Release Signoff Checklist

<!--
**ACTION REQUIRED:** In order to merge code into a release, there must be an
issue in [keylime/enhancements] referencing this enhancement and targeting a release**.

For enhancements that make changes to code or processes/procedures in core
Keylime i.e., [keylime/keylime], we require the following Release
Signoff checklist to be completed.

Check these off as they are completed for the Release Team to track. These
checklist items _must_ be updated for the enhancement to be released.
-->

- [ ] Enhancement issue in release milestone, which links to pull request in [keylime/enhancements]
- [ ] Core members have approved the issue with the label `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented
- [ ] Test plan is in place
- [ ] User-facing documentation has been created in [keylime/keylime-docs]

<!--
**Note:** This checklist is iterative and should be reviewed and updated every time this enhancement is being considered for a milestone.
-->

## Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high quality user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap.  It should be
possible to collect this information before implementation begins in order to
avoid requiring implementers to split their attention between writing release
notes and implementing the feature itself. Reviewers
should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is
useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.
-->

The IMA event logs can grow to multiple thousands of log entries with each
entry being ~100 bytes or even larger when IMA appraisal is being used on
a system. With Keylime initiating frequent attestations, Mbytes of network bandwidth
are consumed for the transfer of the IMA log and many CPU cycles are consumed
by the verifier to verify each IMA log. This enhancement attempts to address
the resource consumption issues by introducing incremental IMA attestation
where the verifier requests only the difference in the IMA log (since last
attestation) using the next-to-request IMA log entry number. This allows the
verifier to resume the verification of the IMA log where it left off the
previous time. For this to work, it also needs to maintain the state of the
IMA PCR alongside the next-to-request IMA log entry number.

In the ideal case, a verifier would only perform the check of the TPM quote
rather than verifying the entire IMA log of a host that has not had any
new entries in its IMA log.

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals and non-goals of
this enhancement.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users.
-->

The motivation of this enhancement is driven by the realization that bandwidth
consumption as well as the CPU cycle consumption can be greatly reduced and
the scalability and efficiency of the Keylime verifier be increased when only
the differences in the IMA logs from the last (previous) attestation verification are
transferred.

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the enhancement.  What is it trying to achieve?  How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

The goal of this enhancement is to reduce network bandwidth consumption as well as
the verifier's CPU cycle consumption and increase overall scalability of
Keylime when IMA attestation is being used.

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this enhancement?  Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation.  The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

The verifier will need to maintain per-agent state that reflects the state
of the IMA PCR from the last attestation along with the next-to-request
IMA log entry. The verifier needs to be extended to request the
IMA log starting at a specific entry in the IMA log. There are no changes
required to the TPM quote.

To maintain backwards compatibility with older verifiers, the updated
agent will return the entire IMA log when the verifier's request does
not contain the number of the next IMA entry to return, which indicates
and 'old' verifier.

Similarly, to maintain backwards compatibility with older agents, an updated
verifier has to be able to deal with the situation where the agent did
not respond with the partial log but the entire IMA log. This situation
is indicated by the agent not returning the number of the first IMA log
entry it returned, thus the verifier will assume the log starts at
the first entry.

From the above it can be seen that the benefits of reduction of network
bandwidth and CPU cycle consumption are only going to take effect when
updated verifiers and updated agents are being used.

While no attestation state is persisted: Upon restart of the verifier,
it will request the IMA log from the first entry (entire log) when resuming
communication with a particular agent. Therefore, startup of the IMA
verification will be as costly (in terms of resource consumption) as it was
before this enhancement.

Once the number of the next-to-request IMA log entry and the state of the
IMA PCR(s) along with the last-known boottime of the agent have been persisted,
the verifier can try to resume the attestation from where it left off.
It will request the measurement list to be sent from the next-to-request IMA
log entry number and the agent will respond with an IMA measurement list
along with its boottime. If the boottime is found to be different than the last
known boot time then the current attestation will be skipped and the next time
a full attestation starting at entry 0 will be requested.

### User Stories (optional)


<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this enhancement is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system.  The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

An administrator who wants to increase the number of systems monitored by
Keylime using IMA and who does not want to use a larger machine or more CPUs dedicated
to the Keylime verifier(s) will find Incremental Attestation support important
since it will require far less CPU cycles during steady-state monitoring (rather
than startup) of those systems.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (optional)

The design is based on the assumption that affinity between a keylime verifier
and agent is maintained.

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above.
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

Since only a pull model is currently implemented in Keylime (verifier
initiates the quote request) we do not need to deal with the case where
affinity of an agent is not maintained during attestation. If this was to
change, then the Keylime verifier will have to read the last state of the
attestation every time before it runs the log verification. Since this it
not necessary today, the implementation will not read the last state every
time.

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate.  Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
enhancement ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed and by whom?
-->

No known risks.

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable.  This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets.  If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

Many of the details are already given above.

The verifier database table will need to be extend with entries for:
- last known boottime of agent system
- state of the IMA PCR(s)
- the next-to-request entry number for the IMA log

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy.  Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly
challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations).
-->

The PR implementing this proposal will add
- unit tests for some newly added functions
- integration tests for testing incremental attestation

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this enhancement
-->

The database migration scripts will be able to handle the upgrade and downgrade
ot the verfier database table.

Compatibility between old verifiers and new agents and new verfiers and old agents is
maintained.

### Dependency requirements

<!--
If your new change requires new dependencies, please outline and demonstrate that your selected dependency 
is well maintained and packaged in Keylime's supported Operating Systems (currently Debian Stable
and as of time writing Fedora 32/33). 

During code implementation you will also be expected to add the package to CI , the keylime ansible role and 
keylimes main installer (`keylime/installers.sh`).

If the package is not available in the supported Operated systems, the PR will not be merged into master. 

Adding the package in `requirements.txt` is not sufficient for master which is where we tag releases from. 

You may however be able to work within an experimental branch until a package is made available. If this is
the case, please outline it in this enhancement.

-->

The be abel to get the boottime of a system we need the psutil package.
We require psutil >=5.4.2 since Ubuntu Bionic provides this version and RHEL 8 provides 5.4.3.

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this enhancement _not_ be implemented?
-->

No known drawbacks.

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider and why did you rule them out?  These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

No known alternatives.

## Infrastructure Needed (optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things infrastructure related specific to your enhancement.  Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, github webhook, changes to CI (travis).
-->

No additional infrastructure is needed.
